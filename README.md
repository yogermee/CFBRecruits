# CFBRecruits Module (In Progress)

The CFBRecruits module was created to gain access to NCAA football recruit data without having to pay for 3rd party API access (which is often sparse, inconsistent, or simply non-existant). Currently, the two largest websites tracking college football recruits are 247sports.com and Rivals.com. Each website ranks both overall university recruiting classes and individual recruits on a state- and nation-wide basis. The CFBRecruits module utilizes Selenium 2.0 to effecitively navigate ever-"shifting" DOM elements to deliver that data to your machine in a readable and easily iterable fashion.

*Currently, the CFBRecruits module will return the following data from both websites:*

1) Complete university recruiting class data by year
2) Average university recruit rating by year
3) The Top 50 recruiting classes by university, by year
